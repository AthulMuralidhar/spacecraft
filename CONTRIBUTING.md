The following represents the core ideals of the Antai Project (TAP). It is mandatory as of April 2, 2019, for all members affiliated or associated with the project must try to abide by these guidelines in the fullest capacity

1) Keep in mind that no one person can save the world. Team work, collabration and feedback is crucial.

2) Decentralization, gives flexibility and brings strength to the project. Small autonomous units that are self-sustaining are much better than a giant dead body.

3) Are you in conflict with the decisions of your team leader? Turn it around with your own code and own solution(s). 

4) Talent and problem solving above all else. If you can solve a problem in the most efficient way, you are the boss.

5) Put yourself in your client's shoes. Ask yourself would you want this as a client? How would it affect you as a potiential consumer?

6) Ask around. Help is always available (inside and out)

7) Remember to collaborate. Give preference to open source solutions.

8) Keep things in order. Remember that every added feature/service/product is sort of a payload for your satellite. Also, make sure that you take out your own trash, coding and otherwise.

9) Give credit where it is due.

10) Build things that stand for eternity. Imagine yourselves to be the Pharohs from ancient Egypt.

11) Flexible work hours. You have to put in a fixed ammount of hours per week, but you are at your own liberty to fix your working hours. Get paid accordingly

12) Learn, Learn and Learn more. When in doubt use the scientific method. If your work dosen't excite you or induce curiosity, it's time that you thought about jumping ship.

13) Treat (and code) others the way you want to be treated ( and shown code)

14) Failure is OK. We are not afraid of failures, but how we learn from it and move on.

15) Be mindful of the impact of your own work. Is it making the world a better place? 

16) Downtime is as important as working time. The Sun will still be shining even if you do not show up for a day. 

17) Be forthcoming if you spot a problem. It is always better to remove a splinter before it turns septic.

18) And finally remember to have fun. Laugh out loud and be proud of your work!
